# 4bit_ALU

# ðŸ”¢ Simple 4-bit ALU in Verilog

This is a basic **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** implemented in Verilog HDL. It performs fundamental operations like **AND, OR, ADD, and SUBTRACT** based on a 3-bit opcode.

---

## Objective

To design and simulate a simple 4-bit ALU using Verilog, as a foundational digital design project for learning HDL and showcasing on GitHub and LinkedIn.

---

## Supported Operations

| Opcode | Operation |
|--------|-----------|
| `000`  | AND       |
| `001`  | OR        |
| `010`  | ADD       |
| `011`  | SUB       |
